## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js (v14 or later)
  * npm
  * MySQL Server

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Piyushkharapkar/QuickServe---Local-service-finder-and-booking-Platform.git
    cd QuickServe---Local-service-finder-and-booking-Platform
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend**

      * Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```sh
        cd Backend
        ```
      * Install NPM packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
      * **Create the database:** In your MySQL client, create a new database named `local_service_db`.
      * **Create the tables:** Run the SQL queries found in the `schema.sql` file (or run them manually) to create the `users`, `listings`, `bookings`, and `reviews` tables.
      * **Create a `.env` file** in the `Backend` root. This is crucial for storing your database credentials and session secret. Copy the contents of `.env.example` or use the template below:
        ```env
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_USER=your_mysql_user
        DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
        DB_DATABASE=local_service_db
        SESSION_SECRET=a_very_long_and_random_secret_string
        ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend**

      * Navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```sh
        cd ../Frontend
        ```
      * Install NPM packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```

4.  **Run the Application**

      * **Start the backend server:** In your `Backend` terminal, run:
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
        The server will be running on `http://localhost:3001`.
      * **Start the frontend client:** In your `Frontend` terminal, run:
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
        The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

You are now ready to explore the QuickServe platform\! You can create customer, provider, and admin accounts to test the full range of features.
